# COA-TASKFORCE-CHALLENGE

This is the Repository for the given coding challenges and a task assigned to perform.

This project is a gallery web application that displays a collection of animal images and  a functions to solve the Coding challenges given. The gallery can be found on the following figma
design [Figma Design for Gallery web Application](https://www.figma.com/design/XF6xlvvHBv12WFveDjVoso/COA-Take-home-Challenge?node-id=0-1). 

# Gallery Web Application

## This  gallery has the following features:
    1. **Hover Interaction**: When you hover on the image, it interactively displays 
        the origin country from where the animal might be found.
    2. **Full-Size Image Viewing**: If you click on the image, you can view it in full size.
    3. **Responsive Design**: You can view this gallery on different screens as you like and
        they all seem good and alike.

## Set up Instructions to run this app:
    1. **Clone the repository**:
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/Jeph2001/COA-TASKFORCE-CHALLENGE.git
        cd Gallery-Task
        ```
    2. **Open the project in your preferred code editor**.
    3. **Run the project**:
        - Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the gallery.

# Coding Challenges Implementation


## This part consists of 2 coding challenges:

    1. Array Manipulation
    2. String Transformation

### 1. Array Manipulation
    This challenge is about determining if there exists a contiguous
    subarray within the array that sums up to the target. 
    Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

### 2. String Transformation
    This challenge is about transform it based on the following rules:
        ● If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
        ● If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its
            ASCII code.
        ● If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5, perform both operations in the
            order specified above


## Set up Instructions to run these apps:
    1. **Clone the repository**:
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/Jeph2001/COA-TASKFORCE-CHALLENGE.git
        cd Challenge
        ```
    2. **Open the apps in your preferred code editor**.
    3. **Run the apps**:
        - Run `arrayMap.js` in your console to test the array manipulation challenge.
        - Run `stringTransform.js` in your console to test the string transformation challenge.
